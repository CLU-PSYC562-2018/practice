# R Markdown

## R Markdown

### R Markdown

_Hypothesis 1_: **This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.**

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r libraries}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

```


Hypothesis 2
```{r trucks}

```

```{r planes}

```

```{r buses}

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
